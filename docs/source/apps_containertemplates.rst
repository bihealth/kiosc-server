Container Templates
===================

Container templates were conceived to facilitate the creation of containers
by offering default settings that can be copied during the creation of an
actual container. Container templates themselves can be duplicated and copied
to different projects. They do exist as a project-wide for every user, and
as site-wide only available for the administrators.

Overview
--------

Find the ``Container Templates`` icon in the left-hand menu to open the Container Template
app. This will list all available container templates and offers the menus to
create, update and delete templates.

Note that the new templates will be visible in all your project on the
KIOSC site.

Detail
------

Click on the title of a container template in the overview to enter the details of a container template.
These are the same details that need to be provided when creating a container.

Create
------

Click ``Create`` to enter the form to create a template. The only mandatory
field is ``Title``. Everything else can be left out, although some values
should be set as the template has no right to exist otherwise.

Copy
----

Select a template from the top-hand dropdown menu and click ``Copy`` to make
a copy of the selected template. A new template with the same title will show
up in the list, only that the title is extended by ``(Copy)``. In the dropdown menu all
templates are listed the current user has access to, plus the site-wide templates.
This enables the user to copy templates from other projects.

Controls
--------

The ``Controls`` dropdown menu (cog icon) comprises
multiple actions that can be issued on template.

Update
^^^^^^

Click this to enter the update form of the template.

Duplicate
^^^^^^^^^

Duplicate is similar to the ``Copy`` action, only that you will make a copy or duplicate
of the template this menu is referring to. A new template with the same title will
show up in the list, only that the title is extended by ``(Duplicate)``.
The result is otherwise the same as when the user would make a copy of that template
with the ``Copy`` action. This means it is just a shortcut to copy templates around
within a template, while the ``Copy`` action is designed to copy templates across projects
or to copy site-wide templates.

Delete
^^^^^^

Delete deletes the template.
