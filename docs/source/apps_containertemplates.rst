Container Templates
===================

Container templates were conceived to facilitate the creation of containers
by offering default settings that can be copied during the creation of an
actual container. Container templates themselves can be duplicated and copied
to different projects. They do exist as a project-wide for every user, and
as site-wide only available for the administrators.
