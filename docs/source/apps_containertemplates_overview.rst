create, update and delete templates.

The difference between project-wide templates and site-wide templates
is that only administrators can create site-wide templates, and as the
name suggests are available on the entry site, i.e. can be used in every
project. Project-wide templates are created in a specific project but
can be accessed in every project the user has access to.
