Requirements
------------

A token is required to validate against the REST API. When logged in to Kiosc,
you can find the **API Tokens** link in your user dropdown menu in the top right corner of the site.
Select **Create Token** from the **Token Operations** dropdown to create a new token.
You will only see the token once, so make sure to copy it to clipboard at this point.
Deleting existing tokens can be done from the token list.
